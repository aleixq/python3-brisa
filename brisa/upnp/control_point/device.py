""" Control point side device implementation.

If you're using the control point high level API with no modifications on the
global flags (located on module brisa), then you shouldn't need to create this
class manually.

The framework default response to a device arrival is to build it and its
services automatically and forward it to your control point on the
"new_device_event" subscribed callback. This callback will receive the device
already ready for all actions.

Service objects contained by a device should be retrieved using the method
Device.get_service_by_type or accessing the Device.services dictionary directly.
